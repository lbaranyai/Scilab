# Scilab
Scilab scripts and demos

## Biochemical reaction
Simulation of the biochemical reaction is introduced in two files: reaction function and the Xcos model. Youtube video is available to demonstrate how the code is built and working.

## SHEET
SHEET is an ERA-NET project. Its full title is "Sunburn and heat prediction in canopies for evolving a warning tech solution". I contribute to it with Scilab codes for modelling of fruit temperature, visualization of 4D data, etc.
