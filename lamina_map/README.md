# Leaf Lamina Map project
This project is managed by the team of two departments of Hungarian University of Agriculture and Life Sciences (MATE). The Department of Viticulture and Department of Food Measurement and Process Control work together. The leaders of the joint efforts are Dr. Péter Bodor-Pesti and Dr. László Baranyai from the departments.

## Software
The software is available presently with version 1.0 as is. It was tested to work and calculate color indices from scanned pictures. The Scilab software and the IPCV toolbox are required to run the code. Please note the CC-BY-NC type of this publication.

## Future plans or to do
* We plan to make a user guide
* Further improve the code based on feedback from users
* Maybe make a toolbox package (questionable at the moment with single code file)
